run_analysis.R -- This is an R script that contains all of the code necessary to 
download, process, clean, sort, and output the data. When finished running, it will output 
the file `cleaned_data.txt` which contains a data set containing average measurements for each
subject and activity. It follows the following 5 steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Additional details on the code can be found in comments within run_analysis.R.

CodeBook -- A code book containing descriptions of the data, variables, and other relevant information.
